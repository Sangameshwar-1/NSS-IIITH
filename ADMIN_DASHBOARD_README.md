# Admin Dashboard Documentation

## Overview

The admin dashboard provides a web interface for managing the NSS IIITH database directly from the website. Admins can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on members and events.

## Access

**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

**Requirements**:
- Must be logged in via CAS authentication
- User's `team` field in database must be set to `ADMIN`

If a non-admin user tries to access the dashboard, they will see an "Access Denied" message.

mutation AddMember($member: MemberInput!) {
  addMember(member: $member)
}
```

**Update Member**
```graphql
mutation ChangeMember($member: MemberInput!) {
  changeMember(member: $member)
}
```

**Delete Member**
```graphql
mutation DeleteMember($id: String!) {
  deleteMember(id: $id)
}
```

### Events

**Add Event**
```graphql
mutation AddEvent($event: EventInput!, $head: MemberInput) {
  addEvent(event: $event, head: $head)
}
```

**Update Event**
```graphql
mutation ChangeEvent($event: EventInput!, $head: MemberInput) {
  changeEvent(event: $event, head: $head)
}
```

**Delete Event**

    graphql_Q&M/

backend/
  qnm_members.py              # Member queries and mutations
  qnm_events.py               # Event queries and mutations
  model_members.py            # Member data model
  model_events.py             # Event data model
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Users must be logged in via CAS
2. **Authorization**: Only users with `team: "ADMIN"` can access the dashboard
3. **No JWT tokens**: Currently using simple cookie-based authentication
4. **Frontend validation**: Form validation ensures required fields are filled
5. **Backend validation**: GraphQL schema enforces type safety

## Improvements for Production

Consider implementing:

1. **Enhanced Security**
   - JWT tokens with expiration
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Audit logs for all changes
   - Rate limiting on mutations

2. **Better UX**
   - Confirmation dialogs with undo option
   - Bulk operations (delete multiple, import CSV)
   - Image upload for member photos
   - Rich text editor for descriptions
   - Data validation with better error messages

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Activity history/changelog
   - Backup/restore database
   - Export data to CSV/JSON
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Email notifications for changes

## Usage Example

1. **Login as admin**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click "Login" and authenticate with CAS
   - Ensure your user has `team: "ADMIN"` in database

2. **Add a new member**:
   - Hover over profile icon ‚Üí click "üõ†Ô∏è Admin Dashboard"
   - Click "üë• Members" tab
   - Click "‚ûï Add Member"
   - Fill in the form
   - Click "üíæ Save"

3. **Update an event**:
   - Click "üìÖ Events" tab
   - Find the event to update
   - Click "‚úèÔ∏è Edit"
   - Modify fields
   - Click "üíæ Save"

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Access Denied" message
- **Solution**: Ensure your user's `team` field is set to `ADMIN` in MongoDB

**Issue**: Changes not saving
- **Solution**: Check browser console for GraphQL errors. Verify backend is running.

**Issue**: Cannot access admin dashboard
- **Solution**: Ensure you're logged in. Check cookie `uid` is set.

**Issue**: GraphQL errors
- **Solution**: Verify all required fields are filled. Check data types match schema.

## Quick Access
