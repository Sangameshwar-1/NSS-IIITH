## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema

**Members Collection:**
```javascript
{
  id: "string",              // username (required)
  name: "string",            // full name (required)
  email: "string",           // email (required)
  rollNumber: "string",      // optional
  role: "string",            // optional (President, etc.)
  year: "string",            // optional
  department: "string",      // optional
  team: "ADMIN|TECH|...",    // required
  status: "ACTIVE|INACTIVE", // required
  start: "string",           // optional
  end: "string",             // optional
  photoUrl: "string",        // optional
  phone: "string",           // optional
  linkedin: "string",        // optional
  github: "string",          // optional
  bio: "string",             // optional
  achievements: ["string"],  // optional
  interests: ["string"]      // optional
}
```

**Events Collection:**
```javascript
{
  name: "string",           // event name (required)
  startTime: "string",      // ISO datetime (required)
  endTime: "string",        // ISO datetime (required)
  location: "string",       // location (required)
  description: "string",    // optional
  eventHead: {              // optional
    id: "string",
    name: "string",
    email: "string"
  }
}
```

### API Endpoints

All operations go through GraphQL:
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8000/graphql`
- **Method**: POST
- **Format**: GraphQL queries/mutations

### Authorization Flow

1. User logs in via CAS → `uid` cookie set
2. User accesses `/admin` → frontend reads `uid` cookie
3. Frontend fetches user's member data via GraphQL
4. Checks if `user.team === "ADMIN"`
5. If yes → show dashboard
6. If no → show "Access Denied"

## 📊 Example Operations

### Adding a Member

```typescript
await addMember({
  id: "john.doe",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@students.iiit.ac.in",
  rollNumber: "2021101001",
  role: "Tech Lead",
  year: "3rd Year",
  department: "CSE",
  team: "TECH",
  status: "ACTIVE",
  phone: "+91 9876543210",
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
  github: "https://github.com/johndoe",
  bio: "Passionate about web development"
});
```

### Adding an Event

```typescript
await addEvent({
  name: "Blood Donation Drive 2025",
  location: "Campus Ground",
  startTime: "2025-03-15T09:00:00",
  endTime: "2025-03-15T17:00:00",
  description: "Annual blood donation camp organized by NSS"
});
```

### Deleting a Member

```typescript
await deleteMember("john.doe");
```

### Deleting an Event

```typescript
await deleteEvent("Blood Donation Drive 2025");
```

- Deletes require confirmation
- No direct database access from frontend
- All operations go through GraphQL API
- CAS authentication required

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Can't access admin dashboard
- **Check**: Are you logged in?
- **Check**: Is your `team` set to `ADMIN` in database?
- **Fix**: Run `python make_admin.py YOUR_USERNAME`

**Problem**: Changes not saving
- **Check**: Browser console for errors
- **Check**: Is backend running?
- **Check**: Are all required fields filled?

**Problem**: "Access Denied" message
- **Fix**: Your user needs `team: "ADMIN"`
- **Run**: `python make_admin.py YOUR_USERNAME` in backend directory
