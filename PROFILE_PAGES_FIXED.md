## ✅ Files Created/Updated

### 1. **`app/members/page.tsx`** ✅ CREATED
- **Purpose:** Members list page
- **Location:** Moved from `components/members/` to `app/members/`
- **Updates:** Changed IDs from numeric (1, 2, 3) to firstname.lastname format
- **Data:** 8 members with usernames like `akshay.chanda`, `sangameshwar.sale`

### 2. **`app/member/profile/[username]/page.tsx`** ✅ CREATED
- **Purpose:** Public member profile route wrapper
- **Type:** Server component
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Extract username from URL params
  - Pass to MemberProfileComponent
  - Provide layout (Navbar + Footer)

### 3. **`app/me/profile/[username]/page.tsx`** ✅ CREATED
- **Purpose:** Own profile route wrapper
- **Type:** Server component
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Extract username from URL params
  - Read logged-in username from cookie (`uid`)
  - Pass both to MyProfileComponent
  - Provide layout (Navbar + Footer)

### 4. **`components/member/profile/MemberProfileComponent.tsx`** ✅ EXISTS
- **Purpose:** Public member profile component
- **Type:** Client component
- **Features:**
  - Display member profile (read-only)
  - "Member Not Found" state
  - Suggestions for available members

### 5. **`components/me/profile/MyProfileComponent.tsx`** ✅ EXISTS
- **Purpose:** Own profile component
- **Type:** Client component
- **Features:**
  - Ownership check
  - Auto-redirect if not own profile
  - Edit button for own profile

### 6. **`components/team/MemberCard.tsx`** ✅ UPDATED

## 👥 Member Data (firstname.lastname format)

All pages now use consistent data with `firstname.lastname` as IDs:

| Username | Name | Email | Team |
|----------|------|-------|------|
| akshay.chanda | Akshay Chanda | chanda.kumar@students.iiit.ac.in | Tech |
| sangameshwar.sale | Sangameshwar Sale | sangameshwar.sale@students.iiit.ac.in | Tech |
| aditi.sharma | Aditi Sharma | aditi.sharma@students.iiit.ac.in | Design |
| rahul.verma | Rahul Verma | rahul.verma@students.iiit.ac.in | Events |
| priya.singh | Priya Singh | priya.singh@students.iiit.ac.in | Tech |
| neha.patel | Neha Patel | neha.patel@students.iiit.ac.in | Design |
| vikram.reddy | Vikram Reddy | vikram.reddy@students.iiit.ac.in | Events |
| rithik.palla | Rithik Reddy Palla | rithik.palla@students.iiit.ac.in | Tech |

## 🍪 Cookie Configuration

The profile system uses cookies for authentication:

**Cookie Name:** `uid`  
**Cookie Value:** `firstname.lastname` (e.g., `sangameshwar.sale`)

**To set cookie:**
```javascript
// Open browser console
document.cookie = "uid=sangameshwar.sale; path=/; domain=localhost"
```

**How it works:**
1. Navbar reads `uid` cookie to check if user is logged in
2. `/me/profile/[username]` route reads `uid` cookie to verify ownership
3. If username matches cookie value → show edit button
4. If username doesn't match → redirect to public profile

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Viewing Members List
```
User visits: /members
  ↓
app/members/page.tsx
  ↓
Renders MembersSection with member data
  ↓
Each MemberCard links to /member/profile/[username]
```

### Viewing Public Profile
```
User clicks member card → /member/profile/akshay.chanda
  ↓
app/member/profile/[username]/page.tsx
  ↓ Extract "akshay.chanda" from params
  ↓
components/member/profile/MemberProfileComponent.tsx
  ↓ Find member with id === "akshay.chanda"
  ↓
components/team/ProfileCard.tsx
  ↓ Display profile (read-only, no edit button)
```

### Viewing Own Profile
```
User visits: /me/profile/sangameshwar.sale
  ↓ Cookie: uid=sangameshwar.sale
  ↓
app/me/profile/[username]/page.tsx
  ↓ Extract "sangameshwar.sale" from params
  ↓ Read cookie: loggedInUsername = "sangameshwar.sale"
  ↓
components/me/profile/MyProfileComponent.tsx
  ↓ Check: "sangameshwar.sale" === "sangameshwar.sale" ✅
  ↓ isOwnProfile = true
  ↓
components/team/ProfileCard.tsx
  ↓ Display profile WITH edit button
```

### Auto-Redirect Flow
```
User visits: /me/profile/akshay.chanda
  ↓ Cookie: uid=sangameshwar.sale
  ↓
MyProfileComponent checks ownership
  ↓ "akshay.chanda" !== "sangameshwar.sale"
  ↓ isOwnProfile = false
  ↓
Show redirect message (2 seconds)
  ↓
Auto-redirect to: /member/profile/akshay.chanda
```

```bash
http://localhost:3000/me/profile/sangameshwar.sale
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Shows your profile

---

### Test 4: Auto-Redirect

**Step 1: Set Cookie**
```javascript
document.cookie = "uid=sangameshwar.sale; path=/; domain=localhost"
```

**Step 2: Try to Access Another's Profile via /me/profile**
```bash
http://localhost:3000/me/profile/akshay.chanda
```

---

### Test 5: Navbar Profile Link

```

**Click profile icon in navbar**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Navigates to `/me/profile/sangameshwar.sale`
- ✅ Shows your profile with edit button

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Proper Separation
- **Routes** (`app/`): Handle routing, params, cookies
- **Components** (`components/`): Business logic, UI, state

### ✅ Consistent URLs
- All use `firstname.lastname` format
- `/member/profile/` for public views
- `/me/profile/` for own profile

### ✅ Member Cards
- Click any member → navigate to profile
- Uses member ID for URL
- Falls back to email extraction if no ID

### ✅ Authentication
- Cookie-based (`uid` cookie)
- Ownership verification
- Auto-redirect for security

### ✅ Clean Architecture
- Server components for data fetching
- Client components for interactivity
- Thin route wrappers
- Reusable components

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Members page not showing?
```bash
# Check if route exists
ls -la /mnt/c/Users/SANGAMESHWAR/Downloads/Website-master1/Website-master/frontend/src/app/members/

# Should show page.tsx
```

### Profile pages not working?
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Edit button not showing?
1. Verify cookie is set: Open DevTools → Application → Cookies
2. Check cookie value matches URL username
3. Ensure you're on `/me/profile/[username]` not `/member/profile/[username]`

### Member cards not clickable?
- Check MemberCard.tsx has proper Link component
- Verify profileUrl is `/member/profile/${username}`
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
